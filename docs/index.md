#### Class Meetings
- 12noon to 1:15 PM on Tuesdays and Thursdays
- Maryland Room 110
- Attendence is encouraged
- Zoom:
    - [https://wse.zoom.us/j/98485708835](https://wse.zoom.us/j/98485708835)
    - Requires authentication via Hopkins SSO to join

#### Course Information
This course teaches students about high-throughput, genome-wide single cell measurements, and approaches to appropriately analyze such data. Real world examples from stem cell biology and developmental biology provide the biological context and motivation, but the computational expertise gained will be broadly applicable. Please see the lecture schedule below for specific topics. By the end of this course, the student should

- Become conversant in the language of sc-omics technologies

- Become a confident practitioner in state-of-the art computational methods needed to analyze sc-omic data

- Learn the fundamentals of stem cell biology

- Gain experience leveraging sc-omics to address perennial questions in the field


#### Recommended Background
- EN.580.151 – Structural Biology of Cells :dna:, or equivalent
- Prior hands on experience coding in Python :simple-python:

#### Course Goals
This course will address the following 'Criterion 3' Student Outcomes:

- An ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science and engineering to solve problems related to stem cell engineering
- An ability to analyze and interpret data using statistical, computational or mathematical methods
- An ability to function on multidisciplinary teams (Criteria 3(d))
- An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility (Criteria 3(f))
- An ability to communicate effectively (writing) (Criteria 3(g))
- An ability to communicate effectively (oral presentation) (Criteria 3(g))

#### Course Topics
- Stem cell biology
- Single cell omics technologies
- Computational tools for the analysis of single cell omics data

#### Ethics
The strength of the university depends on academic and personal integrity. In this course, you must be honest and truthful. Ethical violations include plagiarism, reuse of assignments, improper use of the Internet and electronic devices, unauthorized collaboration, alteration of graded assignments, forgery and falsification, lying, facilitating academic dishonesty, and unfair competition. In addition, the specific ethics guidelines for this course are:

1. Homeworks are to be completed by each student alone. Do not share your projects with other students or use material from prior years.
2. The use of Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are allowed for the homeworks and final project, when doing so is consistent with the stated Course goals and Course expected outcomes (see above). As a guideline, please use LLMs to augment your understanding of the material in the course, to help you to explore algorithmic ideas that might otherwise be challenging to implement, and more generally, to help you to become a more creative problem-solver.

Report any ethics violations you witness to the teaching team. JHU has more information about university misconduct policies for [undergraduate students](http://e-catalog.jhu.edu/undergrad-students/student-life-policies/) and [graduate students](http://e-catalog.jhu.edu/grad-students/graduate-specific-policies/).

#### Grades
- **Homeworks: 10% per homework. 50% total**
    - Detailed expectations will be described for each HW
    - Individual work; assistance from LLMs is allowed per guidelines in the Ethics section above
    - Assignments submitted up to 24 hours late receive a 20 pt penalty per 24 hours late
    - Assignments will not be accepted after next class has begun (during which the assignment answers will be discussed).
- **Tests: 12.5% per test. 50% total**
    - 1 per module; 4 total
    - No devices allowed; Multiple choice, short and longer answer format
